<h1>Image paste Plugin for CKEditor</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a plugin that automatically uploads to the server the images pasted from the clipboard with Firefox in <a href="http://www.ckeditor.com">CKEditor</a>.</p>

<h3>Version history: </h3>
<ol>
  <li>1.0: 28-September-2011. First public version.</li>
  <li>1.1: 7-October-2013. Compatibility with CKEditor 4. Sorry to everyone that has tried to use it before, but I didn't realize that it was broken all along as it's a simple fix that I did long ago in the commercial version.<br>
  At the same time, I'm removing the useless "webkit-fake-url" crap that Safari generates but that it can't be used for anything.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>1. Copying the files</h3>
<p>Extract the contents of the zip in you plugins directory, so it ends up like
    this<br>

			plugin.js
			docs\

</pre>
<h3>2. Adding it to CKEditor</h3>
<p>Now add the plugin in your <em>config.js</em> or custom js configuration
file:
<code>config.extraPlugins='imagepaste'; </code>
</p>

<h3>3. Configuration</h3>
<p>You have to configure the filebrowserImageUploadUrl entry as you might have already done to allow the user to upload images. You can get a simple script to use as a guide for your code <a href="http://alfonsoml.blogspot.com.es/2013/08/a-basic-upload-script-for-ckeditor.html">in this post in my blog</a>.</p>

<h3>4. Use it</h3>
<p>Using Firefox, paste an image into the body of CKEditor. That image will be uploaded to the server and it will use the correct URL instead of "data:".</p>
