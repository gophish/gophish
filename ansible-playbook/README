3) Modify files/config.json with any changes.

# Log in as root with password
ansible-playbook site.yml -i hosts -u root --ask-pass

# Log in as non-root user with SSH key (if root login has been disabled)
ansible-playbook site.yml -i hosts --private-key=private.key -u user --become --ask-become-pass

# Logging in as non-root user without SSH keys
